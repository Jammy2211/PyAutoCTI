        Non-uniformity across the columns of a line pattern_line is due to spikes / drops in the current that
        injects the charge. This is a noisy process, leading to non-uniformity with no regularity / smoothness. Thus,
        it cannot be modeled with an analytic profile, and must be assumed as prior-knowledge about the charge
        injection electronics or estimated from the observed line Line_data.

        Non-uniformity across the rows of a line pattern_line is due to a drop-off in voltage in the current.

        Before adding non-uniformity to the rows and columns, we assume an input line level \
        (e.g. the average current being injected). We then simulator non-uniformity in this region.

        Non-uniformity in the columns is caused by sharp peaks and troughs in the input charge current. To simulator  \
        this, we change the normalization of each column by drawing its normalization value from a Gaussian \
        distribution which has a mean of the input normalization and standard deviation *column_sigma*. The seed \
        of the random number generator ensures that the non-uniform line update_via_regions of each pre_cti_lines \
        are identical.

        Non-uniformity in the rows is caused by the charge smoothly decreasing as the injection is switched off. To \
        simulator this, we assume the charge level as a function of row number is not flat but defined by a \
        power-law with slope *row_slope*.

        Non-uniform line images are generated using the function *simulate_pre_cti*, which uses this \
