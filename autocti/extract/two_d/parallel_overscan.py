        Returns a list of the 2D parallel overscan regions, which is simply the parallel overscan input to the

        This is so that the extract API can be mimicked across all extractors.

        The parallel overscan spans all columns of the image, thus the coordinates x0 and x1 do not change. y0 and y1
        are updated based on the `pixels` input.

        The extracted regions correspond to the parallel overscan [ppppppppppppppp] regions.

        For `pixels=(0,1)` the extracted arrays returned via the `array_2d_list_from()` function keep the first
        parallel FPR of each charge injection region:

        array_2d_list[0] = [ppppppppppppppppppppp]

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels
            The row pixel index which determines the region of the overscan (e.g. `pixels=(0, 3)` will compute the
            region corresponding to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd overscan rows).
