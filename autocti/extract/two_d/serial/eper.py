        """
         Returns a list of the 2D serial EPER regions from the `region_list` containing signal  (e.g. the charge
         injection regions of charge injection data), extracted between two input `pixels` indexes.

         Negative pixel values are supported to the `pixels` tuple, whereby columns in front of the serial EPERs
         (e.g. the FPRs) are also extracted.

         The diagram below illustrates the extraction for `pixels=(0, 1)`:

         The extracted regions correspond to the first serial EPER all charge injection regions:

         region_list[0] = [0, 2, 22, 225 (serial prescan is 3 pixels)
         region_list[1] = [4, 6, 22, 25] (serial prescan is 3 pixels)

         For `pixels=(0,1)` the extracted arrays returned via the `array_2d_list_from()` function keep the first
         serial EPER of each charge injection region:

         array_2d_list[0] = [st0]
         array_2d_list[1] = [st1]

         Parameters
         ----------
         pixels
             The column indexes to extract the trails between (e.g. columns(0, 3) extracts the 1st, 2nd and 3rd columns)

    def binned_region_1d_from(self, pixels: Tuple[int, int]) -> aa.Region1D:
        """
        The `Extract` objects allow one to extract a `Dataset1D` from a 2D CTI dataset, which is used to perform
        CTI modeling in 1D.

        This is performed by binning up the data via the `binned_array_1d_from` function.

        In order to create the 1D dataset a `Layout1D` is required, which requires the `region_list` containing the
        charge regions on the 1D dataset (e.g. where the FPR appears in 1D after binning).

        The function returns the this region if the 1D dataset is extracted from theserial EPERs. The
        charge region is only included if there are negative entries in the `pixels` tuple, meaning that pixels
        before the EPERs (e.g. the FPR) are extracted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels
            The column pixel index to extract the EPERs between (e.g. `pixels=(0, 3)` extracts the 1st, 2nd and 3rd EPER
            columns)
