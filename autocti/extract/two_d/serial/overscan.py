        """
         Returns a list containing the 2D serial verscan region, which is simply the parallel overscan input to the
         object, extracted between two input `pixels` indexes (this is somewhat redundant information, but mimicks
         the `Extract` object API across all other `Extract` objects).

         (top-row, bottom-row, left-column, right-column) = (y0, y1, x0, x1)

         The serial overscan spans all columns of the image, thus the coordinates x0 and x1 do not change. y0 and y1
         are updated based on the `pixels` input.

         Negative pixel values are supported to the `pixels` tuple, whereby columns in front of the serial overscan are
         also extracted.

         The diagram below illustrates the extraction for `pixels=(0, 1)`:

         [] = read-out electronics
         [==========] = read-out register
         [..........] = serial prescan

         [ssssssssss] = serial overscan
         [f#ff#f#f#f] = signal region (FPR) (0 / 1 indicate the region index)

         The extracted regions correspond to the serial overscan [sss] regions.

         For `pixels=(0,1)` the extracted arrays returned via the `array_2d_list_from()` function keep the first
         serial pixels across the columns of the overscan:

         array_2d_list[0] = [s]

         Parameters
         ----------
         pixels
             The column pixel index which determines the region of the overscan (e.g. `pixels=(0, 3)` will compute the
             region corresponding to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd overscan columns).

        """
        The `Extract` objects allow one to extract a `Dataset1D` from a 2D CTI dataset, which is used to perform
        CTI modeling in 1D.

        This is performed by binning up the data via the `binned_array_1d_from` function.

        In order to create the 1D dataset a `Layout1D` is required, which requires the `region_list` containing the
        charge regions on the 1D dataset (e.g. where the FPR appears in 1D after binning).

        The function returns the this region if the 1D dataset is extracted from the serial overscan. This
        assumes the overscan contains EPER trails and therefore all pixels in front of the overscan act as the
        charge region and therefore FPR. This is the case when science imaging flat field data is used.

        The charge region is therefore only included if there are negative entries in the `pixels` tuple, meaning that
        pixels before the overscan (e.g. the FPR) are extracted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels
            The column pixel index to extract the FPRs between (e.g. `pixels=(0, 3)` extracts the 1st, 2nd and 3rd FPR
            columns)
