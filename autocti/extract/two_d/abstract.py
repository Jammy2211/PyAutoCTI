        """
        Extract a region (e.g. the parallel FPR) of every charge injection region on the charge injection image and
        stack them by taking their mean.

        This returns the 2D average of the extracted regions (e.g. the parallel FPRs) of all of the charge injection
        regions, which for certain CCD charge injection electronics one may expect to be similar.

        For fits to charge injection data this function is also used to create images like the stacked 2D residuals,
        which therefore quantify the goodness-of-fit of a CTI model.

        Parameters
        ------------
        array
            The 2D array which contains the charge injection image from which the regions (e.g. the parallel FPRs)
            are extracted and stacked.
        pixels
            The row pixel index to extract the FPR between (e.g. `pixels=(0, 3)` extracts the 1st, 2nd and 3rd
            FPR rows)

        self, array: aa.Array2D, pixels: Tuple[int, int]
    ) -> aa.Array1D:
        """
        Extract a region (e.g. the parallel FPR) of every charge injection region on the charge injection image, stack
        them by taking their mean and then bin them up to a 1D region (e.g. the 1D parallel FPR) by taking the mean
        across the direction opposite to clocking (e.g. bin over the serial direction for a parallel FPR).

        This returns the 1D average region (e.g. of the parallel FPR) of all of the charge injection regions. When
        binning a uniform charge injection this binning process removes noise to clearly reveal the FPR or EPER.
        For non-uniform injections this will provide an average FPR or EPER.

        For fits to charge injection data this function is also used to create images like the stacked 1D residuals,
        which therefore quantify the goodness-of-fit of a CTI model.

        ------------

            stacked.
