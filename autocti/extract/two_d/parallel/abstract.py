        """
        Returns the median values of the `Extract2D` object's corresponding region, where the median is taken over
        all columns of the region(s).

        To describe this function we will use the example of estimating the median of the charge lines in charge
        injection data, by taking the median over every individual column of charge injection (e.g. aligned with the
        FPR).

        The inner regions of the FPR of each charge injection line informs us of the injected level of charge for
        that injection.

        By taking the median of values of the charge injection regions (after accounting for those which have had
        electrons captured and relocated due to CTI), we can therefore estimate the input charge injection
        normalization.

        This function does this for every column of every charge injection. If multiple charge injections are performed
        per column, the median of all charge regions is taken.

        For example, if there are 3 charge injection regions, this function returns a list where each value
        estimates the charge injection normalization of a given charge injection region. The size of this list
        is therefore the number of charge injection columns.

        The function `median_list_of_lists_from` performs the median over each individual charge injection
        region in each column. It therefore estimates multiple injection normalizations per column. for each individual
        charge region. Which function one uses depends on the properties of the charge injection on the instrumentation.
