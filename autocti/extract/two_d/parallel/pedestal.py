        """
        Returns a list containing the 2D pedestral region, which is in the corner of the CCD and extracted using
        the coordinates of the parallel and serial overscan regions.

        (top-row, bottom-row, left-column, right-column) = (y0, y1, x0, x1)

        The parallel pedestal spans all rows of the parallel overscan and columns of the serial overscan. Unlike
        the parallel and serial overscans, the pedestal is not directional. Separatel parallel and serial pedestal
        extractor objects are used to extract the pedestal in theses directions.

        Negative pixel values can be input into the `pixels` tuple, whereby rows in front of the pedestal are
        extracted.

        The diagram below illustrates the extraction for `pixels=(0, 1)`:

        [] = read-out electronics
        [==========] = read-out register
        [..........] = serial prescan

         The extracted regions correspond to the parallel overscan [pepe] regions.

         For `pixels=(0,1)` the extracted arrays returned via the `array_2d_list_from()` function keep the first
         pedestal pixels across the rows of the overscan:

         array_2d_list[0] = [pepe]

         Parameters
         ----------
         pixels
             The row pixel index which determines the region of the overscan (e.g. `pixels=(0, 3)` will compute the
             region corresponding to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd overscan rows).
         pixels_from_end
             Alternative row pixex index specification, which extracts this number of pixels from the end of
             the overscan. For example, if the overscan is 100 pixels and `pixels_from_end=10`, the
             last 10 pixels of the overscan (pixels (90, 100)) are extracted.

        Extract from an `Array2D` the parallel EPERs and return them as a new `Array2D` where everything else (e.g.

        The dimensions of the input array therefore do not change (unlike other `Layout2DCI` methods).
