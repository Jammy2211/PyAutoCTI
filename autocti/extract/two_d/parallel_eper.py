        The extracted regions correspond to the first parallel EPER all charge injection regions:

        region_list[0] = [2, 4, 3, 21] (serial prescan is 3 pixels)
        region_list[1] = [6, 7, 3, 21] (serial prescan is 3 pixels)

        For `pixels=(0,1)` the extracted arrays returned via the `array_2d_list_from()` function keep the first
        parallel EPER of each charge injection region:

        array_2d_list[0] = [t0t0t0tt0t0t0t0t0t0t0]
