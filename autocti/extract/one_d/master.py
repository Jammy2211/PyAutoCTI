        Abstract class containing methods for extracting regions from a 1D line dataset which contains some sort of
        original signal whose profile before CTI is known (e.g. warm pixel, charge injection).

        This uses the `region_list`, which contains the signal's regions in pixel coordinates (x0, x1).

        ----------
        region_list
            Integer pixel coordinates specifying the corners of signal (x0, x1).
        prescan

        overscan
            Integer pixel coordinates specifying the corners of the overscan (x0, x1).
