        Returns a list of the (x0, x1) regions containing the EPERs of a 1D CTI dataset.

        These are used for extracting the EPER regions of 1D data.

        Negative pixel values are supported to the `pixels` tuple, whereby pixels in front of the EPERs (e.g.
        the FPR) are also extracted.

    ----------
        pixels
            The row indexes to extract the trails between (e.g. pixels(0, 3) extracts the 1st, 2nd and 3rd pixels)
