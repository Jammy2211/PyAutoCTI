    """ Add parallel cti to an image using arctic, given the CTI settings and CTI model parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray
        The two-dimensional image passed to arctic for CTI addition, assuming the direction of parallel clocking is \
        upwards relative to a ndarray (e.g towards image[0, :]).
     parameters : ArcticParams
        The CTI parameters (trap density, lifetimes etc.). This may include both sets of model parameters in the \
        parallel and serial direction (e.g. ParallelParams and SerialParams).
    settings : ArcticSettings
        The settings that control arctic (e.g. ccd well_depth express option). This may include both settings in the \
        serial and serial direction (e.g. ParallelSettings and SerialSettings).

    Returns
    ----------
    Two-dimensional image after clocking and therefore with parallel CTI added.

    Notes
    ----------

    This routine adds parallel cti to an image assuming that clocking is upwards relative to a numpy array \
    (e.g towards image[0, :]). Thus, you must be certain the image is oriented in the appropriate direction.

    automatically.
