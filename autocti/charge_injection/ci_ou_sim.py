Note on the rotations of frames:

The function 'non_uniform_frame_for_ou_sim' returns a frame that is rotated according to the ccd_id and quadrant id,
which given the quadrant unique define the orientation of the NumPy array necessary to add paralle and serial
CTI in the correct direction. These are defined accoridng to:

    http://euclid.esac.esa.int/dm/dpdd/latest/le1dpd/dpcards/le1_visrawframe.html

This function will return a frame, which OU-Sim will then add the following effects too:

    - Add cosmic rays.
    - Bias.
    - Non-linearity.
    - Crosstalk?

The addition of CTI can then be performed using either the 'add_cti_to_frame_for_ou_sim' function, or the standard
function OU-Sim use to add CTI (I guess they ultimately both flow through arctic in an identical way, albeit our
code uses SWIG and omits the need to define arCTIc parameter files.

Due to the rotations performed above, this means all images produced will be NumPy arrays oriented in the same way. I 
am not clear on how standard ELViS data products are oriented, but it may be that we require rotations before writing
them to fits to oriented them in the way they are observed (VIS_CTI has tools for this, as I'm sure ELViS does too).
