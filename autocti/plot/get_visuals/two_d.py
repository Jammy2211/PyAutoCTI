        """
        Class which gets 2D attributes and adds them to a `Visuals2D` objects, such that they are plotted on 2D figures.

        For a visual to be extracted and added for plotting, it must have a `True` value in its corresponding entry in
        the `Include2D` object. If this entry is `False`, the `GetVisuals2D.get` method returns a None and the
        attribute is omitted from the plot.

        The `GetVisuals2D` class adds new visuals to a pre-existing `Visuals2D` object that is passed to
        its `__init__` method. This only adds a new entry if the visual are not already in this object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        include
            Sets which 2D visuals are included on the figure that is to be plotted (only entries which are `True`
            are extracted via the `GetVisuals2D` object).
        visuals
            The pre-existing visuals of the plotter which new visuals are added too via the `GetVisuals2D` class.

        """
        From a `FitImagingCI` get its attributes that can be plotted and return them in a `Visuals2D` object.

        Only attributes not already in `self.visuals` and with `True` entries in the `Include2D` object are extracted
        for plotting.

        From a `FitImagingCI` the following attributes can be extracted for plotting:

        - origin: the (y,x) origin of the 2D coordinate system.
        - mask: the 2D mask.
        - border: the border of the 2D mask, which are all of the mask's exterior edge pixels.
        - parallel overscan: the 2D region defining the parallel overscan on the imaging data.
        - serial prescan: the 2D region defining the serial prerscan on the imaging data.
        - serial overscan: the 2D region defining the serial overscan on the imaging data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fit
            The fit imaging object whose attributes are extracted for plotting.

        Returns
        -------
        Visuals2D
            The collection of attributes that are plotted by a `Plotter` object.
