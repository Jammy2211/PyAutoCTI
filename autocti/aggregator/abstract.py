        """
        An abstract aggregator wrapper, which makes it straight forward to compute generators of objects from specific
        samples of a non-linear search.

        For example, in **PyAutoLens**, this makes it straight forward to create generators of `Plane`'s drawn from
        the PDF estimated by a non-linear for efficient error calculation of derived quantities.
        Parameters
        ----------
        aggregator
            An PyAutoFit aggregator containing the results of non-linear searches performed by PyAutoFit.
        clocker
            The CTI arctic clocker used by aggregator's instances. If None is input, the clocker used by the
            non-linear search and model-fit is used.
