- CTI Roadmap - DOCUMENT OF WHAT WE'VE DONE, WHATS NEXT, ETC. Time with new version of arctic.
- Partricia: Non uniform electron density... new feature for FPR of charge injection of a new effect. Show
  Richard 'spatial distribution of electrons' slide.

Features:

    - Mask1D, Line in AutoArray. CTI specific structures using these, for example with overscan / prescans.
    - Implement charge injection line data structure, simulators, example model fits.
    - Implement pipelines + runners for this.
    - Extend to fitting of CI images.
    - Redefine conventions so roe_corner=(0,0) is the unrotated case, this may require a flipud to go into
    EuclidFrame methods (unclear why they are flipped). This is cause arctic clocks towards 0, 0.
    - Make the input of scans parallel size, overscan etc and derive regions.

Euclid:

    - Validation of correction.
    - CTI Issue to do with where results are stored.
    - Follow up DCQT Data quality flags telecom for PE.

VIS Meeting summmay:

- Cold calibration campaign, should use charge injection images to develop a model for the charge injection
  (non uniformity, normalizaton, etc.)

 - Also use to develop trap pumping model, can these images help tell us if we can calibrate CTI using these images?

 - Need to write model descriptions on RedMine for Reiko (CTI, charge inj, trap pumping). This is a neat way to start
   Preparing CI image generation in SIM pipeline. Do we need trap pumping data?

 - Where do we store the CTI calibration data-base? How big wil it be? Will it be distributed?
