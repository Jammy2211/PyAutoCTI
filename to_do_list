__Workspace__

- Copy from Bayesian description stuff from HowToFit.


__Bugs__

- ImagingCI should not _need_ pre_cti_data (or have bool to turn off the need) because of pre_cti image estimate.


__Paper__

- readthedocs.
- introduction notebook.


__Visualization__

- Always use square axis liimits even if extracted data is rectangular.


__TimeEvolution Mock Data Product__

 - Refresh brain on how this works with DataModel.
 - Write a mock data product (e.g. .json files?) using this format.
 - Write VIS_CTI program of function which interpolates CTI model.


__Time Evolution CTI__

- Write simple example, simulate and fit 10 CI datasets with linear time evolution, recover time evolution.
- Extend example based on Richard's HST experience.
- All of the above fit every dataset one-by-one, and perform the estimate of the time evolution model afterwards.
- Scope out implementation in Euclid framework.

- Extend to graphical model for PyAutoFit paper (and maybe Euclid).
- Estimate performance of the one-by-one fits.
- Compare to fits which fit all datasets simultaneously, allowing for variable density in every dataset but fixed
release time.
- Compare to fits which parameterize the variable density as a linear relation across the datasets.
- Implement this linear relation fit in the graphical modeling framework, so we can fit each dataset one-by-one. NOTE:
this will use a "global" release time parameter.


__Validation & Verification__

 - Discuss plan with Richard.
 - Simple simulation of science data (flat?) using correction/


__DataModel__

 - Finalize that outputs of calibration run suit Kevin.
 - Set up XML interface with Kevin.


__Flat Fields__

 - Implement closely following CI.


__Cosmic Ray Flagging__

 - Extend test suite for more realistic data (Non uniform CI, trails).
