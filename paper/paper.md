# Summary

Over the past half a century, space telescopes have given us an extraordinary view of the Universe, for example detecting 
the faint spectra of the first galaxies in the Universe [@Dunlop2013] [@Bouwens2015], measuring tiny distortions in
galaxy shapes due to gravitational lensing [@Massey2007] [@Schrabback2010] and a high precision map of stars within
the Milky Way [@Brown2018] [@Brown2020]. These observations require a deep understanding of the telescope's
instrumental characteristics, including the calibration and correction of charge transfer inefficiency 
(hereafter CTI) [@Massey2010d] [@Massey2014], a phenomena where radiation damage to the telescope's charge-coupled 
device (CCD) sensors leads to gradually increased smearing in acquired exposures over the telescope's lifetime.

`PyAutoCTI` is an open-source Python 3.8+ package for the calibration of CTI for space telescopes. By interfacing
with `arCTIc` (`the algorithm for Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction`) the calibrated CTI models can straightforwardly
be used to correct and remove CTI in every science image taken throughout the telescope's lifetime. Core features 
include fully automated Bayesian model-fitting of CTI calibration data, support for different calibration
datasets such as warm pixels used for Hubble Space Telescope calibration [@Massey2010d] [@Massey2010b] and a database 
for building a temporal model of CTI over the telescope's lifetime. The software places a focus on big data analysis, 
including support for graphical models that simultaneously fits large CTI calibration datasets and an SQLite3 
database that allows extensive suites of calibration results to be loaded, queried and analysed. 
Accompanying `PyAutoCTI` is the [autocti workspace](https://github.com/Jammy2211/autocti_workspace), which includes 
example scripts, datasets and an overview of core `PyAutoCTI` functionality. Readers can checkout
the [readthedocs](https://pyautocti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a complete overview of `PyAutoCTI`'s 
features.



# Background

During an exposure, photons hitting a CCD generate photo-electrons that are held in discrete clouds (pixels) by a grid 
of electrostatic potentials. At the end of the exposure, the potentials are varied so as to move clouds of electrons 
first in the 'parallel' direction to the edge of the CCD, then along the perpendicular 'serial' register to an 
amplifier and read-out electronics that count the number of electrons. The CCD substrate through which the electrons 
move is built of a silicon lattice. However, defects in the lattice known as 'traps' can temporarily capture electrons. 
If this time is longer than the time taken to move a cloud of electrons to the next pixel, an electron may not be 
released back into its original charge cloud, but to a subsequent one: creating a characteristic 'trailing' or 'smearing' 
effect behind sources in the image. The CTI properties of a CCD can be calibrated, using image data that has sharp edges
whose position and flux are known (or can be determined) prior to readout. `PyAutoCTI` fits a CTI model to these sharp
edges and their preceeding trails which form due to CTI.

pixels, with an example warm pixel towards the right zoomed in on. This reveals CTI trailing behind (above) the warm 
pixel, which `PyAutoCTI` fits to calibrate CTI. This figure is taken from [@Massey2010d] and has been used
with the author's permission.](cti_image.png)

Figure 1 shows an example of the CTI calibration data which `PyAutoCTI` was originally developed to fit -- warm 
pixels in the Hubble Space Telescope [@Massey2010d]. Warm pixels are similar to short circuits in the CCD electrostatic 
potentials used to collect charge, which continuously inject spurious charge into specific pixels. These should 
appear as delta functions in the data, with CTI trails appearing in Fig 1 in the parallel clocking direction (upwards in 
Figure 1) next to each warm pixel. `PyAutoCTI` has dedicated functionality for fitting 1D calibration datasets 
such as those extracted from warm pixels. `PyAutoCTI` also supports for 2D calibration datasets, for example 
charge injection line imaging calibration data, which will be used to calibrate CTI for the European Space Agency's 
Euclid space mission. After CTI calibration has inferred an accurate CTI model, this can be passed to `arCTIc` in 
order to correct CTI from science imaging data.

 
# Statement of Need

Space based telescopes planned for launch over the coming decades will map out the Universe's dark matter via
weak gravitational lensing [@Massey2007], make precision detections of exoplanets that are further from Earth than ever
seen before [@Halverson2016] and perform astrometry of moving objects [@Bellini2013]. For these ambitious projects to 
be successful they all require CTI is removed from science imaging with very stringent requirements, necessitating that 
CTI calibration provides in-depth knowledge about CTI on every CCD. `PyAutoCTI` ensures that large CTI calibration 
datasets can be exploited to measure the CTI model over the telescope's life and it provides tools which maximally 
extract information from these datasets using contemporary Bayesian inference techniques.

# Software API and Features

At the heart of the `PyAutoCTI` API are `Trap` objects, which represent the populations of traps on a CCD which cause
CTI. The volume filling behaviour of a CCD is modeled via `CCD` objects, which are combined with traps to compose CTI 
models which add CTI to a mock CTI calibration data via `arCTIc`. `PyAutoCTI` has dedicated objects for specific
CTI calibration datasets and bespoke tools for visualizing these datasets and masking them before fitting.  
The `astropy` cosmology module handles unit conversions and calculations are optimized using the 
packages `NumPy` [@numpy] and `numba` [@numba].

To perform model-fitting, `PyAutoCTI` adopts the probabilistic programming  
language `PyAutoFit` (https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit). `PyAutoFit` allows users to compose a CTI 
model from `Trap` and `CCD` objects, customize the model parameterization and fit it to data via a 
non-linear search, for example `dynesty` [@dynesty], `emcee` [@emcee] or `PySwarms` [@pyswarms]. `PyAutoFit`'s 
graphical modeling framework allows one to fit a temporal model to a suite of CTI calibration data. Using a technique 
called expectation propagation [@Vehtari2020], the framework fits each dataset one-by-one and combines the results of 
every fit into a temporal model using a self-consistent Bayesian framework. To ensure the analysis and interpretation of 
fits to large datasets is feasible, `PyAutoFit`'s database tools write modeling results to a relational database which 
can be queried from a storage drive to a Python script or Jupyter notebook. This uses memory-light `Python` generators, 
ensuring it is practical for use over a telescope's entire lifetime, where CTI calibration data taken with a daily
cadence may consist of thousands of datasets.

# Workspace

`PyAutoCTI` is distributed with the [autocti workspace](https://github.com/Jammy2211/autocti_workspace), which 
contains example scripts for modeling and simulating CTI. The workspace is accessible 
on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Jammy2211/autocti_workspace/HEAD) and example scripts can therefore be run 
without a local `PyAutoCTI` installation.
