# In this pipeline, we'll perform a basic analysis which fits a single parallel trap species to a set of charge
# injection imaging data. This will include a hyper-phase which scales the noise in the analysis, to prevent
# over-fitting the highest S/N charge injection images. The pipeline uses three phases:

# Phase 1) Fit a small section (the left-most 60 columns) of the charge injection images using a parallel CTI model
#          with 1 trap species and a model for the parallel CCD volume filling parameters.

# Phase 1h) Use the best-fit model from phase 1 to scale the noise of each image, to ensure that the higher and
#          lower S/N images are weighted more equally in their contribution to the likelihood.

# Phase 2) Refit the phase 1 model, using priors initialized from the results of phase 1 and the scaled noise-map
#          computed in phase 2.
