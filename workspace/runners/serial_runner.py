# Welcome to the pipeline runner. This tool allows you to CTI calibration data on strong lenses, and pass it to
# pipelines for a PyAutoCTI analysis. To show you around, we'll load up some example data and run it through some of
# the example pipelines that come distributed with PyAutoCTI.

# The runner is supplied as both this Python script and a Juypter notebook. Its up to you which you use - I personally
# prefer the python script as provided you keep it relatively small, its quick and easy to comment out data-set names
# and pipelines to perform different analyses. However, notebooks are a tidier way to manage visualization - so
# feel free to use notebooks. Or, use both for a bit, and decide your favourite!

# The pipeline runner is fairly self explanatory. Make sure to checkout the pipelines in the
#  workspace/pipelines/examples/ folder - they come with detailed descriptions of what they do. I hope that you'll
# expand on them for your own personal scientific needs
