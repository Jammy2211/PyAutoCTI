### NOTE - if you have not already, complete the setup in 'workspace/runners/cosma/setup' before continuing with this
### cosma pipeline script.

# Welcome to the Cosma pipeline runner. Hopefully, you're familiar with runners at this point, and have been using them
# with PyAutoCTI to model CTI on your laptop. If not, I'd recommend you get used to doing that, before trying to
# run PyAutoCTI on a super-computer. You need some familiarity with the software and before trying to model a large
# amount of charge injection imaging on a supercomputer!

# If you are ready, then let me take you through the Cosma runner. It is remarkably similar to the ordinary pipeline
# runners you're used to, however it makes a few changes for running jobs on cosma:

# 1) The data path is over-written to the path '/cosma5/data/durham/cosma_username/autocti/data' as opposed to the
#    workspace. As we saw in the setup, on cosma we don't store our data in our workspace.

# 2) The output path is over-written to the path '/cosma5/data/durham/cosma_username/autocti/output' as opposed to
#    the workspace. This is for the same reason as the data.

# Given your username is where your data is stored, you'll need to put your cosma username here.
cosma_username = 'pdtw24'

# Get the relative path to the config files and output folder in our workspace.
path = '{}/../'.format(os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__)))

# Use this path to explicitly set the config path, and override the output path with the Cosma path.
conf.instance = conf.Config(config_path=path+'config',
                            output_path='/cosma5/data/durham/'+cosma_username+'/autocti/output')

# Lets take a look at a Cosma batch script, which can be found at 'workspace/runners/cosma/batch/pipeline_runner_cosma'.
# When we submit a PyAutoLens job to Cosma, we submit a 'batch' of jobs, whereby each job will run on one CPU of Cosma.
# Thus, if our lens sample contains, lets say, 4 lenses, we'd submit 4 jobs at the same time where each job applies
# our pipeline to each image.

# The fifth line of this batch script - '#SBATCH --array=1-4' is what species this. Its telling Cosma we're going to
# run 4 jobs, and the id's of those jobs will be numbered from 1 to 4. Infact, these ids are passed to this runner,
# and we'll use them to ensure that each jobs loads a different image. Lets get the cosma array id for our job.
batch_id = int(sys.argv[1])
cosma_array_id = int(sys.argv[2])

# For a given COSMA run, we will assume all of the charge injection data-sets have identical properties. That is, they
# all have the same dimensions (shape), charge injection regions (ci_regions), charge injection normalizations
# (normalizations), charge injection patterns (patterns) and frame geometries defining the direction clocking and CTI
# (frame_geometry).

# If you need to change these value for a COSMA run, I recommend making a different runner script.

# The shape of the charge injection images, which is required to set up their charge injection regions
shape = (2316, 2119)

# The charge injection regions on the CCD, which in this case is 7 equally spaced rectangular blocks.
ci_regions = [(0, 330, 51, shape[1]-20), (330, 2316, 51, shape[1]-20)]

# The normalization of the charge injection for each image.
normalizations=[100.0, 500.0, 1000.0, 5000.0, 10000.0, 25000.0, 50000.0, 84700.0]

# Create the charge injection pattern objects used for this pipeline.
patterns = ci_pattern.uniform_from_lists(normalizations=normalizations, regions=ci_regions)

# The frame geometry of the charge injection images we are fitting.
frame_geometry = ci_frame.QuadGeometryEuclid.bottom_left()

# Now, I just want to really drive home what the above line is doing. For every job we run on Cosma, the cosma_array_id
# will be different. That is, job 1 will get a cosma_array_id of 1, job 2 will get an id of 2, and so on. This is our
# only unique identifier of every job, thus its our only hope of specifying for each job which image they load!

# Fortunately, we're used to specifying the data name as a string, so that our pipeline can be applied to multiple
# images with ease. On Cosma, we can apply the same logic, but put these strings in a list such that each Cosma job
# loads a different lens name based on its ID. neat, huh?

ci_data_name.append(data_name+'/parallel_x3_species_model_6') # Index 5
ci_data_name.append(data_name+'/parallel_x3_species_model_7') # Index 6

# We now use the ci_data_name list to load the image on each job, noting that in this example I'm assuming our data is
# on the Cosma data directory folder called 'example_cosma'.
cosma_data_path = '/cosma5/data/durham/'+cosma_username+'/autocti/data/'

# We then create the path to the data itself inside this folder, based on the data name and model.
