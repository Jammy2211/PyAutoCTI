2D Data Structures
------------------

Two-dimensional data structures store and mask 2D arrays containing data (e.g. images) and
grids of (y,x) Cartesian coordinates.

1D Data Structures
------------------

One-dimensional data structures store and mask 1D arrays containing data (e.g. 1D CTI datasets
images) and grids of (y,x) Cartesian coordinates.
