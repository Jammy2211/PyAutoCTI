Numba
=====

Numba (https://numba.pydata.org)  is an optional library which makes **PyAutoCTI** run a lot faster, which we strongly
recommend all users have installed.

However, some users have experienced difficulties installing numba, meaning they have been unable to try out
**PyAutoCTI** and determine if it the right software for them, before committing more time to installing numba
successfully.

For this reason, numba is an optional installation, so that users can easily experimenttick_maker.min_value and learn
the basic API.

If you do not have numba installed, you can do so via pip as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numba


Troubleshooting (Conda)
-----------------------

Numba can be installed as part of your conda environment, with this version of numba used when you make the
conda environment.

If you cannot get numba to install in an existing conda environment you can try creating a new one from fresh,
which is created with numba

To install (or update) numba in conda use the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install numba

When you create the conda environment run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n autocti numba astropy scikit-image scikit-learn scipy

You can then follow the standard conda installation instructions give here `<https://pyautocti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/conda.html>`_

Troubleshooting (Numpy)
-----------------------

The libraries ``numpy`` and ``numba`` can be installed with incompatible versions.

An error message like the one below occurs when importing **PyAutoCTI**:

.. code-block:: bash

    Traceback (most recent call last):

        raise ImportError("Numba needs NumPy 1.21 or less")
    ImportError: Numba needs NumPy 1.21 or less

This can be fixed by reinstalling numpy with the version requested by the error message, in the example
numpy 1.21 (you should replace the ``==1.21.0`` with a different version if requested).

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numpy==1.21.0
