Installation with pip
=====================

Install
-------

We strongly recommend that you install **PyAutoCTI** in a
`Python virtual environment <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/>`_, with the link attached
describing what a virtual environment is and how to create one.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade pip

The latest version of **PyAutoCTI** is installed via pip as follows (specifying the version as shown below ensures
the installation has clean dependencies):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install autocti

The CTI clocking algorithm, arCTIc, is an optional install, because there are uaes for **PyAutoCTI** that do not
require it and it can present difficulties to install.

However, for the majority of users arCTIc will be needed, so we recommend you install it now.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install arcticpy

If there is an error (e.g. issues with installing GSL) check out the `troubleshooting section <https://pyautocti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/troubleshooting.html>`_.

If this raises no errors **PyAutoCTI** is installed!

Numba
-----

Numba (https://numba.pydata.org)  is an optional library which makes **PyAutoCTI** run a lot faster, which we
strongly recommend users have installed.

You can install numba via the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install numba

Some users have experienced difficulties installing numba, which is why it is an optional library. If your
installation is not successful, you can use **PyAutoCTI** without it installed for now, to familiarize yourself
with the software and determine if it is the right software for you.

If you decide that **PyAutoCTI** is the right software, then I recommend you commit the time to getting a
successful numba install working, with more information provided `at this readthedocs page <https://pyautocti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/numba.html>`_

Workspace
---------

Next, clone the ``autocti workspace`` (the line ``--depth 1`` clones only the most recent branch on
the ``autocti_workspace``, reducing the download size):

.. code-block:: bash

   cd /path/on/your/computer/you/want/to/put/the/autocti_workspace
   git clone https://github.com/Jammy2211/autocti_workspace --depth 1
   cd autocti_workspace

Run the ``welcome.py`` script to get started!

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 welcome.py

It should be clear that **PyAutoCTI** runs without issue.

If there is an error check out the `troubleshooting section <https://pyautocti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/troubleshooting.html>`_.
