Overview
========

**PyAutoCTI** requires Python 3.8+ and support Linux and MacOS operating systems (Windows support is targeted in the future).

To use **PyAutoCTI** the c++ library **arCTIc** (https://github.com/jkeger/arctic) must also be installed. Installation instructions for **arCTIc** can be found both
on its GitHub page and in the **PyAutoCTI** readthedocs.

**PyAutoCTI** can be installed via the Python distribution `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ or using
`Pypi <https://pypi.org/>`_ to ``pip install`` **PyAutoCTI** into your Python distribution.

We recommend Anaconda as it manages the installation of many major libraries (e.g. numpy, scipy,
matplotlib, etc.) making installation more straight forward.

The installation guide for both approaches can be found at:

- `Anaconda installation guide <https://pyautocti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/conda.html>`_

- `PyPI installation guide <https://pyautocti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/pip.html>`_

Users who wish to build **PyAutoCTI** from source (e.g. via a ``git clone``) should follow
our `building from source installation guide <https://pyautocti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/source.html>`_.

Known Issues
------------

There is a known issue installing **PyAutoCTI** via both ``conda`` and ``pip`` associated with the libraries ``llvmlite``
and ``numba``. If your installation raises an error mentioning either library, follow the instructions in
our `troubleshooting section <https://pyautocti.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/troubleshooting.html>`_.
