Parallel and Serial
===================

The descriptions and animations of the previous overview described CCD clocking as a 1D process, whereby electrons were
trailed as they move in one direction towards read-out electronics.

However, the images from the Hubble Space Telescope we looked at are 2D, and CCD clocking is of course a 2D process.
So, lets adjust our picture of how CCD clocking works to one that is two dimensional.

Below is a schematic of a 2D image, called a "charge injection image". This image does not contain galaxies or stars.
Instead, the signal is created using electronics at bottom of the CCD (furthest from the read out electronics) which
inject a current (e.g. rows of electrons into every pixel) across the CCD.

This injection is turned on and off, creating the regions of the data with signal (the yellow / orange rectangles in
the image below) interspersed around regions with no charge.

(It turns out that charge injection images are crucial to calibrating CTI -- a process we have to undertake before
we can correct CTI in data. We cover this in overviews 4 and 5!).

Two Dimensional CCD
-------------------

The CCD above has ``2046 + 20 = 2066`` rows of pixels and ``51 + 2048 + 29 = 2128`` columns of pixels (these are the
dimensions of a CCD quadrant of the Euclid space satellite).

As a reminder, a 'pixel' describes a group of electrons that are collectively held together in the same electrostatic
potential in the CCD, and therefore read out together in the same pixel after clocking.

Clocking and read-out of a 2D image extends the 1D description above as follows:

 1) An entire row of 2066 electrons are shifted, all at once, by adjusting the electrostatic potential in every pixel
 simultaneously. In the diagram above this shift is in the upwards direction.

 2) These electrons enter the special row of pixels shown at the top of the schematic, called the 'read-out register',
 where they are held in place with a special row of electrostatic potentials. This is called '**parallel** clocking'.

 3) At the far end of the read-out register are the read-out electronics. This was seen in the 1D animations in the
 previous overview and is located at the top-left of the schematic above. The 2066 electrons, now located in the
 read-out register, are clocked towards read out electronics and converted from an analogue to digital signal.
 This is called '**serial** clocking.

 3) After all 2066 electrons are read out, the read-out register is now empty and the next row of 2066 electrons are
 shifted into it.

 4) This process is repeated until all 2128 columns of electrons have been read-out and converted to a digital signal.

In the example above, serial clocking has to shift 2066 electrons, one pixel at a time, into the read out electronics.
For every 2066 shifts, parallel clocking has to move only a single row of electrons (all at once) into the read out
register.

Serial clocking is therefore much faster than parallel clocking, in the example above around ~2000 times faster.
Keep this in mind!

arCTIc
------

Now, lets perform 2D clocking and CTI addition using arCTIc. First, lets make a scaled down version of the charge
injection image, which will simply contain a 3x3 square of pixels containing 100 electrons surrounded by pixels which
are empty.

This uses an ``Array2D`` object, which is a class representing a 2D data structure and is a 2D extension of the
``Array1D`` objected used in the previous overview. It again inherits from a numpy ndarray and is extended
with functionality which is expanded upon elsewhere in the workspace.

.. code-block:: python

    import autocti as ac

    pre_cti_data_2d = ac.Array2D.no_mask(
                values=[
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 10.0, 10.0, 10.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
        ],
        pixel_scales=0.1,
    )

**PyAutoCTI** has a built in visualization library for plotting 2D data (amongst many other things)!

.. code-block:: python

    import autocti.plot as aplt

    array_2d_plotter = aplt.Array2DPlotter(array=pre_cti_data_2d)
    array_2d_plotter.figure_2d()

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoCTI/main/docs/overview/images/overview_2/pre_cti_data_2d.png

To model the CCD clocking process, including CTI, we create a **PyAutoCTI** ``Clocker2D`` object, which calls arCTIc
via a Python wrapper.

.. code-block:: python

    clocker_2d = ac.Clocker2D()

CTI Model (Parallel)
--------------------

We again need to define our CTI model, that is the number of traps our 2D data encounters when we pass it through the
clocker and replicate the CCD clocking process.

We will again use a trap which captures electrons instantaneously and define the ccd's phase describing how the
electron cloud fills pixels.

You'll note that the variables below use the prefix ``parallel_``, which indicates that this is only accounting for
CTI in the parallel clocking direction.

.. code-block:: python

    parallel_trap = ac.TrapInstantCapture(density=1.0, release_timescale=5.0)
    parallel_ccd = ac.CCDPhase(
        well_fill_power=0.58, well_notch_depth=0.0, full_well_depth=200000.0
    )

We group these into a ``CTI2D`` object.

.. code-block:: python

    cti = ac.CTI2D(parallel_trap_list=[parallel_trap], parallel_ccd=parallel_ccd)

We can now add parallel CTI to our 2D data by passing it through the 2D clocker.

For our 2d ndarray which has shape (10,8) parallel clocking goes upwards towards entries in the
row pre_cti_data_2d[0, :]. CTI trails should therefore appear at the bottom of the ``pre_cti_data_2d`` after each
block of 10 electrons.

.. code-block:: python

    post_cti_data_2d = clocker_2d.add_cti(
        data=pre_cti_data_2d, cti=cti
    )

    array_2d_plotter = aplt.Array2DPlotter(array=post_cti_data_2d)
    array_2d_plotter.figure_2d()

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoCTI/main/docs/overview/images/overview_2/post_cti_data_2d_parallel.png
  :width: 600

CTI Model (Serial)
------------------

We can do the exact same for serial clocking and CTI.

Because serial clocking is ~x1000 faster than parallel clocking, this means it is subject to a completely different
landscape of traps. For this reason, we always define our parallel and serial CTI models separately and it is common
for them to have different densities. For illustrative purposes, our serial CTI model has two unique trap species.

The way an electron cloud fills a pixel in the read-out register is different to the main pixels, meaning for serial
clocking and CTI we also define a unique ``CCDPhase``.

.. code-block:: python

    serial_trap_0 = ac.TrapInstantCapture(density=2.0, release_timescale=2.0)
    serial_trap_1 = ac.TrapInstantCapture(density=4.0, release_timescale=10.0)

    serial_ccd = ac.CCDPhase(
        well_fill_power=0.58, well_notch_depth=0.0, full_well_depth=200000.0
    )

    cti = ac.CTI2D(serial_trap_list=[serial_trap_0, serial_trap_1], serial_ccd=serial_ccd)

We can now add serial CTI to our 2D data by passing it through the 2D clocker.

For our 2d ndarray which has shape (10,8) serial clocking goes left towards entries in the column
pre_cti_data_2d[:, 0]. CTI trails should therefore appear at the right of the ``pre_cti_data_2d`` after each
block of 10 electrons.

.. code-block:: python

    post_cti_data_2d = clocker_2d.add_cti(
        data=pre_cti_data_2d,
        cti=cti
    )

    array_2d_plotter = aplt.Array2DPlotter(array=post_cti_data_2d)
    array_2d_plotter.figure_2d()

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoCTI/main/docs/overview/images/overview_2/post_cti_data_2d_serial.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Alternative text

CTI Model (Parallel + Serial)
-----------------------------

We can of course add both parallel and serial via the same arCTIc call.

In this case, parallel CTI is added first, followed by serial CTI, where serial CTI is added on top of the post-cti
image produced after parallel clocking. This is the same order of events as occurs on a real CCD.

This means we expect to a small number of electrons trailed into the corner of our post-cti image, which are the
parallel CTI trails then trailed during serial clocking.

.. code-block:: python

    cti = ac.CTI2D(
        parallel_trap_list=[parallel_trap],
        parallel_ccd=parallel_ccd,
        serial_trap_list=[serial_trap_0, serial_trap_1],
        serial_ccd=serial_ccd,
    )

    post_cti_data_2d = clocker_2d.add_cti(data=pre_cti_data_2d, cti=cti)

    array_2d_plotter = aplt.Array2DPlotter(array=post_cti_data_2d)
    array_2d_plotter.figure_2d()

Correcting CTI
--------------

Correcting CTI in 2D is as easy as it was in 1D, by simply calling the clockers ``remove_cti()`` method.

.. code-block:: python

    corrected_cti_image_2d = clocker_2d.remove_cti(data=post_cti_data_2d, cti=cti)

    array_2d_plotter = aplt.Array2DPlotter(array=corrected_cti_image_2d)
    array_2d_plotter.figure_2d()

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoCTI/main/docs/overview/images/overview_2/post_cti_data_2d_corrected.png

Wrap Up
-------

We now understand how a CCD works in two dimensions and are able to add and correct CTI to 2D image data.

The remaining question is, if we have data containing CTI which we wish to correct, how do we choose our CTI model?
How do we know the density of traps on the CCD? How do electrons fill pixels?

We'll begin to cover this in the next overview, first explaining how these different properties of the CTI model
change the way CTI appears in a dataset; information we will later use to calibrate a CTI model.
