CTI Calibration
---------------

In the previous overview, we learnt how to fit a CTI model to a dataset and quantify its goodness-of-fit via a log
likelihood.

We are now in a position to perform CTI calibration, that is determine the best-fit CTI model to a charge injection
dataset. This requires us to perform model-fitting, whereby we use a non-linear search algorithm to fit the
model to the data.

CTI modeling with **PyAutoCTI** uses the probabilistic programming language
`PyAutoFit <https://github.com/rhayes777/PyAutoFit>`_, an open-source Python framework that allows complex model
fitting techniques to be straightforwardly integrated into scientific modeling software. Check it out if you
are interested in developing your own software to perform advanced model-fitting!

Whereas previous tutorials loaded a single charge injection dataset, this tutorial will load and fit three datasets
each with a different injection normalizations. This is necessary for us to be able to calibrate the CTI model's
CCD volume filling.

Dataset
-------

We set up the variables required to load the charge injection imaging, using the same code shown in the previous
overview.

Note that the ``Region2D`` and ``Layout2DCI`` inputs have been updated to reflect the 30 x 30 shape of the dataset.

.. code-block:: bash

    shape_native = (30, 30)

    parallel_overscan = ac.Region2D((25, 30, 1, 29))
    serial_prescan = ac.Region2D((0, 30, 0, 1))
    serial_overscan = ac.Region2D((0, 25, 29, 30))

    regions_list = [(0, 25, serial_prescan[3], serial_overscan[2])]

    normalization_list = [100, 1000.0, 10000.0]

    total_ci_images = len(normalization_list)

    layout_list = [
        ac.ci.Layout2DCI(
            shape_2d=shape_native,
            region_list=regions_list,
            parallel_overscan=parallel_overscan,
            serial_prescan=serial_prescan,
            serial_overscan=serial_overscan,
        )
        for i in range(total_ci_images)
    ]

We load each charge injection image, with injections of 100e-, 1000e- and 10000e- so that we have the information
required to calibrate the volume filling behaviour of the CCD.

.. code-block:: bash

    dataset_label = "overview"
    dataset_type = "calibrate"
    dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "imaging_ci", dataset_label, dataset_type)

    imaging_ci_list = [
        ac.ci.ImagingCI.from_fits(
            image_path=path.join(dataset_path, f"data_{int(normalization)}.fits"),
            noise_map_path=path.join(dataset_path, f"noise_map_{int(normalization)}.fits"),
            pre_cti_data_path=path.join(
                dataset_path, f"pre_cti_data_{int(normalization)}.fits"
            ),
            layout=layout,
            pixel_scales=0.1,
        )
        for layout, normalization in zip(layout_list, normalization_list)
    ]

Clocking
--------

We define the ``Clocker`` which models the CCD read-out, including CTI.

For parallel clocking, we use 'charge injection mode' which transfers the charge of every pixel over the full CCD.

.. code-block:: bash

    clocker = ac.Clocker2D(parallel_express=2, parallel_roe=ac.ROEChargeInjection())

Model
-----

We compose the CTI model that we fit to the data using autofit ``Model`` objects.

These behave analogously to the ``TrapInstantCapture`` and ``CCDPhase`` objects but their parameters (e.g. ``density``,
``well_fill_power``) are not specified and are instead determined by a fitting procedure.

In this example we fit a CTI model with:

 - One parallel ``TrapInstantCapture``'s which capture electrons during clocking instantly in the parallel direction
 [2 parameters].

 - A simple ``CCD`` volume filling parametrization with fixed notch depth and capacity [1 parameter].

The number of free parameters and therefore the dimensionality of non-linear parameter space is N=3.

.. code-block:: bash

    parallel_trap_0 = af.Model(ac.TrapInstantCapture)
    parallel_traps = [parallel_trap_0]

    parallel_ccd = af.Model(ac.CCDPhase)
    parallel_ccd.well_notch_depth = 0.0
    parallel_ccd.full_well_depth = 200000.0

We combine the trap and CCD models above into a ``CTI2D`` and ``Collection`` object, which is the model we will fit.

The ``CTI2D`` object can be easily extended to contain model components for serial CTI. Furthermore, the ``Collection``
object can be extended to contain other components of a model other than just the CTI model, for example nuisance
parameters that represent features in the CCD.

.. code-block:: bash

    model = af.Collection(
        cti=af.Model(ac.CTI2D, parallel_traps=[parallel_trap_0], parallel_ccd=parallel_ccd)
    )

Non-linear Search
-----------------

We now choose the non-linear search, which is the fitting method used to determine the set of CTI model parameters
that best-fit our data.

In this example we use ``dynesty`` (https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty), a nested sampling algorithm that is
very effective at lens modeling.

.. code-block:: bash

    search = af.DynestyStatic(name="overview_modeling_2d")

Analysis
--------

.. code-block:: bash

    analysis_list = [
        ac.AnalysisImagingCI(dataset_ci=imaging_ci, clocker=clocker)
        for imaging_ci in imaging_ci_list
    ]

By summing this list of analysis objects, we create an overall ``Analysis`` which we can use to fit the CTI model, where:

 - The log likelihood function of this summed analysis class is the sum of the log likelihood functions of each
 individual analysis object.

 - The summing process ensures that tasks such as outputting results to hard-disk, visualization, etc use a
 structure that separates each analysis and therefore each dataset.

.. code-block:: bash

    analysis = sum(analysis_list)

We can parallelize the likelihood function of these analysis classes, whereby each evaluation is performed on a
different CPU.

.. code-block:: bash

    analysis.n_cores = 2

Model-Fit
---------

We can now begin the model-fit by passing the model and analysis object to the search, which performs a non-linear
search to find which models fit the data with the highest likelihood.

All results are written to hard disk, including on-the-fly results and visualization of the best fit model!

Checkout the folder ``autocti_workspace/output/imaging_ci/parallel[x2]`` for live outputs of the results of the fit!

.. code-block:: bash

    result_list = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

Result
------

The search returns a result object, which includes:

 - The charge injection fit corresponding to the maximum log likelihood solution in parameter space.

.. code-block:: bash

    for result in result_list:

        fit_plotter = aplt.FitImagingCIPlotter(fit=result.max_log_likelihood_fit)
        fit_plotter.subplot_fit_ci()

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoCTI/master/docs/overview/images/overview_6/result_ml.png
  :width: 600
  :alt: Alternative text

It also contains the maximum likelihood CTI model, allows us to print the best-fit values of the parameters.

.. code-block:: bash

    max_log_likelihood_cti_model = result_list[0].max_log_likelihood_instance.cti

    print(max_log_likelihood_cti_model.parallel_traps[0].density)
    print(max_log_likelihood_cti_model.parallel_traps[0].release_timescale)
    print(max_log_likelihood_cti_model.parallel_ccd.well_fill_power)

Calibration in 1D
-----------------

We can also perform CTI calibration on 1D datasets.

.. code-block:: bash

    shape_native = (30,)

    prescan = ac.Region1D((0, 1))
    overscan = ac.Region1D((25, 30))

    region_1d_list = [(1, 25)]

    normalization_list = [100.0, 1000.0, 10000.0]

    layout_list = [
        ac.Layout1D(
            shape_1d=shape_native,
            region_list=region_1d_list,
            prescan=prescan,
            overscan=overscan,
        )
        for normalization in normalization_list
    ]

    dataset_line_list = [
        ac.DatasetLine.from_fits(
            data_path=path.join(dataset_path, f"data_{int(normalization)}.fits"),
            noise_map_path=path.join(dataset_path, f"noise_map_{int(normalization)}.fits"),
            pre_cti_data_path=path.join(
                dataset_path, f"pre_cti_data_{int(normalization)}.fits"
            ),
            layout=layout,
            pixel_scales=0.1,
        )
        for layout, normalization in zip(layout_list, normalization_list)
    ]

    clocker = ac.Clocker1D(express=2)


We define the ``Clocker`` which models the CCD read-out, including CTI.

For parallel clocking, we use 'charge injection mode' which transfers the charge of every pixel over the full CCD.

.. code-block:: bash

    clocker_1d = ac.Clocker1D(express=2, roe=ac.ROEChargeInjection())

We again compose a CTI model that we fit to the data using autofit ``Model`` objects.

.. code-block:: bash

    trap_0 = af.Model(ac.TrapInstantCapture)
    traps = [trap_0]

    ccd = af.Model(ac.CCDPhase)
    ccd.well_notch_depth = 0.0
    ccd.full_well_depth = 200000.0

We combine the trap and CCD models above into a ``CTI1D`` and ``Collection`` object, which is the model we will fit.

.. code-block:: bash

    model = af.Collection(cti=af.Model(ac.CTI1D, traps=traps, ccd=ccd))

We again use ``dynesty`` (https://github.com/joshspeagle/dynesty) to fit the model.

.. code-block:: bash

    search = af.DynestyStatic(name="overview_modeling_1d")

We next create a list of ``AnalysisDatasetLine`` objects, which each contain a ``log_likelihood_function`` that the
non-linear search calls to fit the CIT model to the data.

We again sum these analyses objects into a single analysis.

.. code-block:: bash

    analysis_list = [
        ac.AnalysisDatasetLine(dataset_line=dataset_line, clocker=clocker)
        for dataset_line in dataset_line_list
    ]

    analysis = sum(analysis_list)

    analysis.n_cores = 2

We can now begin the model-fit by passing the model and analysis object to the search, which performs a non-linear
search to find which models fit the data with the highest likelihood.

.. code-block:: bash

    result_list = search.fit(model=model, analysis=analysis)

The search returns a result object, which includes:

 - The fit corresponding to the maximum log likelihood solution in parameter space.

.. code-block:: bash

    print(result_list[0].max_log_likelihood_instance.cti.traps[0].density)
    print(result_list[0].max_log_likelihood_instance.cti.ccd.well_fill_power)

    for result in result_list:

        fit_plotter = aplt.FitDatasetLinePlotter(fit=result.max_log_likelihood_fit)
        fit_plotter.subplot_fit_dataset_line()
